My experience in development is 5 years. 2.5 years as a developer and 2.5 years as a senior developer and the Engineering manager.

As a manager, I led a team of 5 people I recruited (juniors - middles, distributed team). Also, I have 2 outsource teams that I supervise. In our in-house team, I set up and led Scrum activities.
							</p>
							<p class="enlarge">
As a project manager, I lead TOR preparation and formation, I participate in negotiations with the contractor (including price-related questions).

								<h3>Engineering manager </h3>
								<h4>Sep 2022 - now</h4>


							</div>

                             <div class="job">
								 <h2>Commercial public cloud:  <a href="https://www.datafort.ru/">DataFort (Beeline Cloud)</a></h2>
								<h3>Head of development department </h3>
								<h4>Jan 2021 - Sep 2022</h4>
								 <p>
								 <h3>* Build a development department from scratch. </h3><br>
								A team of 5 people has been assembled. <br>
								 I led the hiring process, shaped and facilitated processes of onboarding and adaptation.<br>
								 We have team building activities, regular 1:1s and feedbacks.<br>
								 <br> Together we've built CI/CD, we have good-documented code base and knowledge-sharing inside a team. <br>
								 I facilitate the process of deployment planning, analyze risks and prepare plans to mitigate such.<br>
								 Each sprint I take 2-3 development tasks, write tests and do code review.
								</p>

								 <p>
								 <h3>* Implemented SCRUM in the development team. </h3><br>
							 	We have 2 weeks sprints. Each sprint we have retro, refinement and planning activities.<br>
								<br> In the result of the SCRUM implementation work processes of the development
							 	department have become more transparent and manageable,
								and the team's self-organization has increased (the team plans the last sprints on its own).
								Lined up a system of regular increment delivery to business.
								 </p>
							 	<p>
								 <h3>* Organized the transfer of two departments work processes from Excel to the CRM system. </h3><br>
								 I was responsible for the collection and formation of technical specifications,
								 selection of a contractor, contract formalisation, price negotiation. <br>
								 We were doing the project with an external contractor. So acceptance process,
								 migration and training of departments' employees were my responsibilities too. <br>
								 <br> In the result of moving to the CRM the work processes of Sales and Presale
								 departments have become more transparent,
								staff productivity has increased, and the quality of customer service has improved.
								</p>
								 <p>
								 <h3>* Automated the process of collecting statistics on customer consumption. </h3><br>
								When I started to work in the company, collecting statistics on customer
								consumption was mostly manual.  <br>
								I collected requirements from the financial and technical departments.
								Prioritized and approved the procedure for implementing automation.
								Using the internal development team, we have automated the manual collection of statistics for more than 10 services.  <br>
								<br>
								 As a result of automation, customers began to receive detailed consumption reportsx.
								The financial department began to receive more accurate data,
								and resources were freed up in the technical department. The company's profit grew up.
								 </p>

								 <p>
								 <h3>* Migrated legacy service to new technologies. </h3><br>
								There was a service on the python2 without tests and documentation.
							 	The developers of this software were not available for contact.
							 	The service performed a critical role for the business, about 60% of the company's profit depended on its work. <br>
								My team and I migrated the service to new technologies. We wrote documentation, covered it with tests,
								 and split it into services. We made the user interface to reduce the amount of manual work of developers.  <br><br>
								As a result of automation, the cost of service support has decreased, monitoring has improved qualitatively.
								 The risks of failures in business-critical functionality have been significantly reduced.
								 </p>

								<h3>Backend developer </h3>
								<h4>Apr 2020 - Jan 2021</h4>
								<p>
								 <h3>*  Single-handedly maintain and develop new
								functionality for digital pathomorphology system (python, node.js, JS).
								</h3><br>
								Company's product was a platform for diagnosing cancer with a large amount of data
								(each patient image weighed from 3 to 9 GB). Previous development team left company without any
								documentation or knowledge transfer. So our team had to accept a service with a load
								of about five thousand patients per week and with KPI to make a diagnosis - no more than 72 hours.
							  	My own responsibility was 3 services responsible for diagnosis.
								Also we had to quickly migrate from Amazon to our own servers.
								<br><br>
								As a result the services of my responsibility's area have become more stable
								(the number of requests from users has decreased by about 60%),
								there are autotests, documentation, a description of the applied architectural solutions.
								Also, the delivery of updates to the client for half a year of my development went without
								any problems.
